    "description": "<p>ScrapeLogo has been discovered and developed by Maintop Businesses, originally only for internal purposes. It was coded as an independent service for several Maintop&rsquo;s B2B projects. When requests from other companies multiplied, a private beta version was launched too. We are now looking for the first beta testers, who would like to show company logos on their websites and help us improve the quality and precision of our algorithm.<\/p>",
